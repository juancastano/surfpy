# surfpy

Wave and weather tools written in python. 

This package aims to create a suite of tools than can be used to generate and create surf forecasts. It aims to give a developer the ability to build their own customize wave and weather forecasts and applications based off only NOAA data available for free. It does not interface third party APIs, as they dont give the same depth of information needed to craft fully customized and **free** forecasts. 

## Running the Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest
```
