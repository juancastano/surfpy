# Examples

## Install the `surfpy` library

Before running the examples you must have the lirbary installed. You can install from the root project directory running either of the below commands. The second creates a symlink so you can modify code on the fly. 

```bash
pip install .

# or 

pip install -e .
```

## Install other dependencies. 

These examples show off how to plot and format data in visual ways using Matplotlib so it must be installed prior to running the example scripts.

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
```
